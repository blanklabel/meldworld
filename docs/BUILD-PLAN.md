# MELDWORLD Build Plan

Execution plan for AI agent teams. Contracts: `GDD.md`, `CANON.md` (wins on conflict), and `spec/`. Read `CANON.md §S` before writing any code — system boundaries are non-negotiable.

**Spec citation convention:** detail files are cited as `parent.md → detail` (e.g., `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md → battle` means the battle detail file adjacent to that index). Resolve to the actual detail filename in `spec/` at task start.

```

### T1 — Shared Protocol & Schema

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | Single source of truth for every wire type, message envelope, DTO, enum, and error code, published as one plain Rust crate (`meld-proto`) consumed directly by both server and client — no codegen, no second language; own `balance/balance.toml` and CI skeleton. |
| **Owns** | `/shared/meld-proto`, `/balance/balance.toml`, CI pipeline structure, wire-type change review. |
| **Contract specs** | `spec/interfaces/data-models.md` (+ all 6 detail files), `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md` (+ session, movement-world, battle, run-social), `spec/interfaces/http-api.md` (+ all 6 detail files), `CANON.md §I` (IDs, envelope, error codes), `CANON.md §G` (canonical names), `spec/edge-cases/limits.md` (field bounds). |
| **Non-goals** | No business logic, no serialization logic beyond plain serde derives + validated field types, no gameplay constants decisions (values come from CANON/spec; T1 only hosts them). |
| **Consumes** | Nothing from other teams. Root of the dependency graph. |

### T2 — Rust Server Core (world, movement, runs, disconnect)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | Authoritative overworld: seeded world gen, chunk streaming, movement validation, instance/run lifecycle, disconnect/sleep/ward handling, WS gateway + session. |
| **Owns** | `meld-server`, `meld-world`, `meld-run`. |
| **Contract specs** | `spec/behaviors/world-generation.md`, `spec/behaviors/run-lifecycle.md`, `spec/behaviors/disconnect-handling.md`, `spec/behaviors/async-interaction.md` (overworld half: drops, ward placement, heal-into-battle routing), `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md` → session, movement-world, run-social; `spec/edge-cases/limits.md`. |
| **Non-goals** | No ATB math (calls T3's `meld-battle` API), no direct DB writes for persistent state (calls `meld-econ`/`meld-db` interfaces at run end), no rendering assumptions. |
| **Consumes** | T1 `meld-proto` (all messages), T3 `meld-battle` crate API (start/tick/merge/resolve battles), T3 `meld-econ` banking API (extraction → vault, death → durability). |

### T3 — Rust Server Combat + Economy Services

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | Server-authoritative ATB engine (100 ms tick, gauges, actions, merge, flee, auto-defend); the entire HTTP API incl. username+password auth (bcrypt cost 12, opaque Bearer session tokens, single-use realtime tickets — D17); persistence in **Postgres** (D18: schema, migrations, snapshots); economy transactions (escrow, tax, repairs); leaderboards/seasons. |
| **Owns** | `meld-battle`, `meld-econ`, `meld-api`, `meld-db` (the Postgres schema and everything that touches it). |
| **Contract specs** | `spec/behaviors/combat-atb.md`, `spec/behaviors/economy.md`, `spec/behaviors/meta-progression.md`, `spec/behaviors/endgame-seasons.md`, `spec/interfaces/http-api.md` (+ all 6 details), `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md` → battle; `CANON.md §B` (formulas), `CANON.md §D17` (auth), `CANON.md §D18` (Postgres), `spec/edge-cases/limits.md`. |
| **Non-goals** | No movement/chunk logic, no WS connection management (T2's gateway routes battle messages into `meld-battle`), no client code. |
| **Consumes** | T1 `meld-proto` + `balance.toml`, T2 battle-trigger events + WS routing (in-process API defined jointly, T3 proposes trait, T2 implements gateway side). |

### T4 — Bevy Overworld Client & Art Pipeline

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | The Bevy app shell + overworld: rendering, tile/chunk display, input → movement intents, client prediction + interpolation, other-player presence, drops/wards/sleeping avatars/battle markers, collision presentation. Owns the **HD-2D art pipeline (D16)**: sprite/tile import pipeline, 3D-lit 2D rendering, depth-of-field and particle passes. Asset *creation* is out of scope for agent teams — placeholder assets are acceptable through M5. |
| **Owns** | `/client/crates/meld-client` (app shell, overworld, HD-2D render path, asset pipeline). |
| **Contract specs** | `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md` → session, movement-world, run-social; `spec/behaviors/world-generation.md` (tile semantics, biome tables — render only), `spec/behaviors/async-interaction.md` (drop/pickup UX), `CANON.md §S` (never computes outcomes), `CANON.md §D16` (HD-2D direction). |
| **Non-goals** | No UI screens (T5's job — battle/hub/menu screens live in `meld-ui`), no HTTP calls, no authoritative collision/combat, no persistence, no hand-authored final art. Prediction is presentation-only and must reconcile to server snapshots. |
| **Consumes** | T1 `meld-proto` crate, T2 live WS server (movement/chunk/presence), T5 state-routing contract (shared Bevy app states + transition triggers — defined jointly in `client/app-states.md`, T5 owns doc). |

### T5 — Bevy UI Team

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | All in-app UI, built in Bevy in the same client codebase as T4: auth screens, ATB battle UI (dynamic multi-party layout), hub UIs (Vault, Training Ground, Stall shop, Bounty Board, crafting/repair, leaderboards), menus; the screen/state-routing layer (shared Bevy app states: `Overworld ↔ Battle ↔ HubScreen` transitions); HTTP client plumbing in Rust. |
| **Owns** | `/client/crates/meld-ui` and the `client/app-states.md` state-routing contract doc. |
| **Contract specs** | `spec/interfaces/http-api.md` (+ all 6 details), `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md` → session, battle, run-social; `spec/behaviors/combat-atb.md` (render/intent semantics only), `spec/behaviors/economy.md` + `meta-progression.md` + `endgame-seasons.md` (screen flows), `spec/edge-cases/limits.md` (input validation mirrors), `CANON.md §D16/§D17`. |
| **Non-goals** | Never computes combat outcomes, damage, or prices — displays server results only. No direct DB. No overworld/world rendering (that's T4's `meld-client`; T5 screens are Bevy states layered in the same app). |
| **Consumes** | T1 `meld-proto` crate, T3 HTTP API + battle S2C stream (via T2 gateway), T4 app shell: shared `AppState` scaffold, overworld view, and the S2C event bus that drives state transitions. |

### T6 — QA / Verification

| | |
|---|---|
| **Mission** | Turn `spec/` into numbered claims and executable conformance tests via the spec-extractor pipeline (`spec-derive-claims`, `spec-derive-interface-claims`, `spec-generate-claim-tests`, `spec-verify-compliance`); own integration harness, headless bot clients, load/chaos tooling; gate every milestone. |
| **Owns** | `/qa` (claims files, conformance suites, bot framework, load harness, chaos scripts, milestone gate reports). |
| **Contract specs** | ALL of `spec/` — T6 is the enforcement arm of the whole spec tree, plus `CANON.md §B` networking targets for load tests. |
| **Non-goals** | Never patches production code to make tests pass (files findings against owning team); doesn't own unit tests (each team writes their own — T6 owns cross-boundary conformance). |
| **Consumes** | T1 `meld-proto` crate (bots speak the real wire format), T2/T3 running server (docker-compose target from M0), the T4/T5 client build for smoke automation. |

| # | Blocked | Blocker | Satisfying artifact | Needed by |
|---|---------|---------|--------------------|-----------|
| D-1 | T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 | T1 | `meld-proto` Rust crate v0.1 with session/movement/error types (consumed by server + client workspaces); `balance.toml` v0.1 | M0 exit |
| D-2 | T4 | T2 | WS server streaming ≥1 chunk + movement snapshots against localhost | M1 |
| D-3 | T5 | T3 | `/v1/auth/login` (username+password, bcrypt-verified, opaque session token + realtime ticket) + `/v1/players/me` live | M1 |
| D-4 | T2 | T3 | `meld-battle` crate: `start_battle / submit_intent / tick / merge / resolve` trait | M2 |
| D-5 | T5 | T3 | Battle S2C messages emitted end-to-end (via T2 gateway) | M2 |
| D-6 | T2 | T3 | `meld-econ` banking API: `bank_extraction(backpack)`, `apply_death(gear)` | M2 |
| D-7 | T5 | T4 | Shared `AppState` scaffold merged in `meld-client` (state enum, transition hooks, UI-screen registration points) + `client/app-states.md` agreed | M1 (stub), M2 (real) |

| D-9 | T5 | T3 | economy endpoints (stalls, contracts, repairs) | M4 |
| D-10 | T6 gates | spec/ authors | spec files frozen per-milestone (see §5) | each M gate |

**Parallelism note:** T2 and T3 are peers, not a chain — they integrate through two narrow in-process traits (D-4, D-6) that must be PR'd in week 1 of M1 as `.rs` trait definitions with mock impls, so each side codes against mocks until M2 integration.

---

## 3. Milestones

Every criterion is a binary check runnable by an agent (command or conformance test ID). A milestone gate = all criteria green + T6 conformance suite for that milestone green.

### M0 — Scaffolding, schema pipeline, CI
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M0.1 | `cargo build --workspace` passes from clean clone for both the server and client workspaces. |
| M0.2 | Wire stability: every message/DTO in `meld-proto` round-trips byte-identically against committed golden fixtures; CI fails on fixture drift without a versioned `meld-proto` bump. |
| M0.3 | Server and client workspaces resolve the identical `meld-proto` version (CI lockfile check — one crate, no forked copies); a `session.hello` envelope round-trip test passes against the golden fixture. |
| M0.4 | `balance.toml` parses and contains every `[TUNABLE]` constant named in `CANON.md` §D/§B; server crate loads it at boot (test asserts no hardcoded duplicates via lint script). |
| M0.5 | `docker compose up` starts server + Postgres (D18); `GET /v1/healthz` returns 200 and the server has applied migrations against Postgres. |
| M0.6 | CI runs on every PR: fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, unit tests, golden-fixture freshness, per-team test suites. |
| M0.7 | T6 has run `spec-derive-interface-claims` over `spec/interfaces/` and committed numbered claims to `/qa/claims/interfaces/`. |

### M1 — Walking skeleton
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M1.1 | `POST /v1/auth/login` (username + password per D17) issues an opaque Bearer session token + a single-use realtime ticket; bad credentials return `unauthorized` envelope per `CANON.md §I` (conformance test `qa/conformance/http/auth`). |
| M1.2 | WS connect presenting the realtime ticket completes `session.*` handshake per `spec/interfaces/realtime-protocol.md → session`; invalid, expired, or already-used ticket gets documented close code. |
| M1.3 | Server generates and streams the chunk at world origin (64×64 tiles, seeded, deterministic: same seed → identical tile hash across two boots). |
| M1.4 | Bot client sends movement intents; server-validated position echoes in snapshots at 10 Hz ±20% (measured over 30 s). |
| M1.5 | Two bot clients in the same instance each observe the other's position within 300 ms of movement (T6 harness asserts). |
| M1.6 | Illegal move (wall clip / speed > `limits.md` cap) is rejected: server position does not change (conformance test). |
| M1.7 | Bevy app logs in via the T5 auth screen and transitions to the `Overworld` app state rendering the origin chunk with the local avatar moving (headless integration smoke via bot-driven screenshot diff acceptable). |
| M1.8 | Passwords are stored **only** as bcrypt hashes (cost 12) in Postgres: after registration, the `password_hash` column parses as a `$2*$12$` bcrypt hash, and the plaintext appears nowhere in the DB dump or server logs captured during the test. |
| M1.9 | Login with an unknown username and login with a wrong password return **identical** responses: same status, same error envelope byte-for-byte modulo `request_id` (no username-enumeration oracle; conformance test asserts equality). |

### M2 — Core loop vertical slice (Forest, one monster, full loop)
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M2.1 | Party of 1 enters maze from Center Hub: `Run` created, `run_level == base_run_level(center) == 1`, empty Backpack (assert via `run-social` messages + `/v1/runs/{id}`). |
| M2.2 | Forest biome (d 0–100) generates with ≥1 monster spawn type; touching a monster opens a `Battle` server-side and emits battle S2C to the client. |
| M2.3 | Full ATB battle completes server-side: gauge fills at `speed_stat/400` per 100 ms tick, intents resolve, victory awards XP + loot to Backpack (conformance test drives via battle C2S only — no client math). |
| M2.4 | 15 s action timeout triggers auto-defend (test with a silent bot). |
| M2.5 | Extraction at a portal banks Backpack into Vault atomically; `GET /v1/vault` reflects items; Run status `extracted`. |
| M2.6 | Death deletes Backpack + run level; blue-chest gear returns at `max_durability × 0.9` rounded down; red-chest gear in Backpack is gone (asserted via vault-gear endpoints). |
| M2.7 | The Bevy ATB battle screen (T5, entered via the `Overworld → Battle` state transition) plays a complete battle against the live server: displays gauges/HP from S2C only (fault-injection test: server sends absurd damage number, UI shows it — proving no client-side recompute). |
| M2.8 | T6 `spec-generate-claim-tests` suite for `run-lifecycle` + `combat-atb` claims: 100% of M2-tagged claims pass. |
| M2.9 | HD-2D render path (D16) is live for the M2 slice: sprites/tiles render in a 3D-lit scene with depth-of-field and particle passes enabled, verified by screenshot diff against goldens on a fixed seed (placeholder assets acceptable — final art is out of scope through M5). |

### M3 — Multiplayer depth
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M3.1 | 4 players form a party in Hub, enter one `MazeInstance` with shared seed; instance not joinable post-entry (join attempt → documented error). |
| M3.2 | Battle merge: second party touching an engaged enemy joins at gauge 0; enemy stats do not rescale (assert stat snapshot pre/post); merged cap enforced (2 instances normal / 4 Gatekeeper, from `balance.toml`). |
| M3.3 | Disconnect in standard encounter → forced flee within grace window +1 tick; in elite/Gatekeeper → auto-defend state visible to allies (chaos test kills TCP mid-battle). |
| M3.4 | 10 s reconnect grace: reconnect at 9 s restores control with no state loss; at 11 s avatar is `sleeping` on the overworld. |
| M3.5 | Roaming monster touching a sleeping avatar starts a battle against it (auto-defend); a `warding_tent` deployed on it makes it invisible to pathfinding for 30 min (time-warped test clock). |
| M3.6 | Player B drops a potion onto Player A's active battle marker; A's in-battle HP increases server-side within 1 tick (`spec/behaviors/async-interaction.md`). |
| M3.7 | Backpack item dropped on overworld is visible to and pickable by another instance member; pickup is atomic (two bots race, exactly one succeeds). |
| M3.8 | Instance with all members disconnected 60 min auto-abandons: backpacks deleted, no durability loss (time-warped test). |

### M4 — Meta + economy
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M4.1 | Gatekeeper arena at d=499 is a full-width chokepoint: pathfinding proves no route past without per-instance clear flag. |
| M4.2 | Defeating a Gatekeeper drops a `ClassEmblem`; extraction unlocks the class on the account (`/v1/players/me` shows it); starting a run with that class works. |
| M4.3 | Run from D500 Outer Hub starts at `run_level == 40`; Training Ground template application allocates skill points before entry (HTTP conformance). |
| M4.4 | Meld skills level per `spec/behaviors/meta-progression.md`: a successful craft raises Forging XP; contract completion raises Mercantile; rare-material extraction raises Alchemy (three conformance tests). |
| M4.5 | Repair: Forging-L crafter restores max durability capped at `base_max × (0.5 + L/198)` — boundary tests at L1, L50, L99. |
| M4.6 | Stall lifecycle: deploy → owner logs off → another player purchases → chits minus `max(5%, 10% − mercantile×0.05%)` tax land in owner escrow (atomicity: concurrent double-buy of last item, exactly one succeeds with `conflict`). |
| M4.7 | Contract escrow: posting locks reward chits (`insufficient_funds` if short); fulfillment pays taxed reward; 7-day expiry auto-refunds (time-warped). |
| M4.8 | Stall placement gates enforced: Mercantile <30 in a d≥1000 hub → `forbidden`. |
| M4.9 | Gem crafted via Alchemy slots into blue-chest gear and its stat effect appears in server battle math (assert damage delta with/without gem). |

### M5 — Endgame + performance
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M5.1 | World gen past d=5000 continues indefinitely (bot walks to d=6000); `stat_mult` switches to the exponential branch exactly at d=5000 (unit test on formula + integration spot check). |
| M5.2 | Prestige aura items drop only past d=5000 per loot tables (10k simulated rolls, zero below threshold). |
| M5.3 | Vanguard Board updates in real time: instance reaching a new max distance appears on `/v1/leaderboards/vanguard` within 5 s. |
| M5.4 | Season rollover (time-warped to week-13 UTC boundary): board archived read-only, top-100 titles granted, infinite-zone board reset, vault/meld/unlocks untouched (assert all four). |
| M5.5 | Load: 500 concurrent bot connections, 20 Hz sim, 10 Hz snapshots — p99 intent→snapshot latency < 250 ms, zero desyncs, server RSS stable over 30 min (`qa/load/` report artifact). |
| M5.6 | 50 concurrent battles tick at 100 ms with p99 tick overrun < 10 ms. |

### M6 — Hardening
| # | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|
| M6.1 | Anti-cheat suite green: forged messages (impossible speed, acting with empty gauge, spending unowned chits, extracting mid-battle, negative-quantity purchases, out-of-range interactions per `limits.md`) are all rejected with documented errors and produce no state change. |
| M6.2 | Chaos suite green: random kill/reconnect of 20% of 200 bots over 1 h — no orphaned battles, no duplicated backpack items, no stuck instances (invariant checker passes). |
| M6.3 | Server crash mid-run: restart from snapshot; persistent state intact, run state restored-or-cleanly-abandoned per `spec/behaviors/disconnect-handling.md` (no item dupes — vault diff is empty or matches banked set). |
| M6.4 | Lint proves zero gameplay constants outside `balance.toml`; changing a tunable + reboot changes observed behavior (spot test on hub tax). |
| M6.5 | Full T6 claims run: 100% of interface claims and ≥98% of capability claims pass; every failure has a filed exception approved via spec PR. |
| M6.6 | `spec-verify-compliance` scorecard committed to `/qa/reports/final/`; zero HIGH-severity gaps. |

## 5. Working Agreements

1. **Spec is the contract.** `GDD.md` → `CANON.md` → `spec/` is the precedence chain. If implementation reveals a gap or contradiction, file a PR against `CANON.md`/the spec file and block on its merge. **Silent divergence is a build-breaking offense** — T6 conformance failures caused by undocumented behavior are always assigned to the implementing team, not to T6.
2. **All [TUNABLE] constants live in `/balance/balance.toml`, owned by T1.** No gameplay number appears as a literal in any crate/package (CI lint, M0.4/M6.4). Formula *structure* is code; formula *coefficients* are config. Balance changes are one-line config PRs, never code PRs.
3. **Server is authoritative (`CANON.md §S/§D11`).** Clients submit intents and render server results. Any client-side computation is presentation-only (prediction, interpolation) and must reconcile. T6's fault-injection tests (M2.7, T4-04) exist specifically to catch client-side recompute — treat them as tripwires, not formalities.
4. **Boundary rule is mechanical:** survives logout → HTTP API; ephemeral → realtime protocol. A message or endpoint on the wrong channel is rejected in schema review by T1.
5. **Every task lands with tests.** Unit tests in the owning package + a verification note satisfied (see task tables). PRs without the task's named verification are not mergeable. Cross-boundary behavior is additionally covered by T6 conformance — passing local tests does not exempt a team from the milestone gate.
6. **Wire-type changes go through T1.** Any wire/DTO change is a `/shared/meld-proto` PR reviewed by T1 + every consuming team; golden fixtures are updated in the same PR (CI enforces fixture freshness, T1-14 enforces crate semver). No team forks or vendors the crate — server and client consume the one shared version (M0.3).
7. **Integration checkpoints:** each milestone gate runs T6's full conformance suite for that milestone plus all previous ones (no regression). A milestone is closed only when the gate report is committed to `/qa/reports/M{n}/` with all criteria green. Spec files covered by a closed milestone are frozen — reopening requires a CANON/spec PR that also updates the affected claims in `/qa/claims/`.
8. **Cross-team interfaces are trait/doc artifacts, landed early.** D-4/D-6 traits (T3→T2) and `client/app-states.md` + the `AppState` scaffold (T5↔T4) must merge with mocks/stub screens in the first week of M1 so teams integrate against mocks, then swap real implementations without API churn.
9. **Time and randomness are injectable everywhere** (test clock, seeded RNG) — multiple gate criteria (M3.5, M3.8, M4.7, M5.4) are time-warped, and world gen determinism (M1.3) is load-bearing for T6's oracles.
10. **Findings flow:** T6 files findings against the owning team with the claim ID + spec citation; owning team either fixes code or PRs the spec (per rule 1). Disputes escalate to a CANON.md decision entry (new §D row), which is final.
